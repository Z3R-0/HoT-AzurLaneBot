# AzurLaneBBot

**A Discord bot for cataloging, categorizing, and commenting on the skins of Azur Lane‚Äôs ever-expanding fleet of shipgirls.**  
Built with C#/.NET, DDD principles, and a healthy dose of naval fashion analysis.

---

## ‚ú® What is this?

AzurLaneBBot is a Discord bot project focused on collecting and interacting with cosmetic data from the game *Azur Lane*. Users can register and explore character skins, tag visual traits, and (eventually) vote, filter, and engage with shipgirl fashion in novel ways.

This project is meant both as a fun experiment and a vehicle for practicing clean software architecture patterns like Domain-Driven Design (DDD), CQRS, and proper separation of concerns.

It‚Äôs a somewhat cheeky in theme, but quite serious in code and implementation (no like, seriously).

## üß† Why?

This project scratches a few itches:

- Exploring practical DDD and architecture patterns
- Building a bot that reflects the uniquely obsessive creativity of fandoms
- Pushing data modeling and metadata tagging to absurd (and fun) depths

## ü§ù License

MIT. Feel free to fork, use, repurpose, or ignore ‚Äî especially if you have a similar weird little bot idea brewing.

---

## üôÉ Disclaimer

This bot references and categorizes in-game cosmetics from *Azur Lane*, which contains stylized fictional characters. While the subject matter leans playful (and honestly VERY fan-servicey lately), the goal here is data structure, not objectification. Consider this an exploration in metadata ‚Äî and yes, I‚Äôm aware of how that sounds. 'Research purposes' and whatnot...
